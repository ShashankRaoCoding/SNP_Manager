# SNP Manager 

This is a simple library and related projects built by Shashank Rao over the course of 6 weeks during august of 2024. These are made to enable faster and easier working with SNP data, with functions to export for use in other softwares such as FUMA. 

Related projects use this library and/or other lirbaries to further enable plotting of SNPs or working with heat maps. Note that some of these programs may require input data to be in specific formats.
